This is an animation of the analytic solution, for the acoustic field
of a pulsating tube, described by Blackstock "Fundamentals of Physical
Acoustics" p. 409.

What I find interesting here is the following. You have an
approximation of the impedance Z in the near field, equation (C-20),
then you can use it to approximate the value of pressure in the
surrface of the tube, as p=Z*u, and it is expected this approximation
will improve as the tube radius a decreases. This animation shows that
the approximation converges really slow, for a tube with a radius a
million times smaller than the wavelegth, the relative error is still
in the order fo 10%.
