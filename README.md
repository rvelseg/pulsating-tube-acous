# Description

This is an animation of the analytic solution, for the acoustic field
of a pulsating tube, described by Blackstock "Fundamentals of Physical
Acoustics" p. 409.

What I find interesting here is the following. You have an
approximation of the impedance Z in the near field, equation (C-20),
then you can use it to approximate the value of pressure in the
surrface of the tube, as p=Zu, and it is expected this approximation
will improve as the tube radius, *a*, decreases. This animation shows
that the convergence rate is really slow, mainly because of the phase
shift, for a tube with a radius a million times smaller than the
wavelegth, the relative error is still in the order of 10%.
